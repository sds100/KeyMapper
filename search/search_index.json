Download the apk from GitHub Actions. This requires a GitHub account. You can get alpha builds here and beta builds here . Click on a 'workflow run' and then scroll down to see the 'artifacts'. If a build was successful then you can find the apk here. Info All testing builds have .ci.X at the end of the version name where 'X' is a number is incremented every time a new build is made. Builds are made when a new feature or bug fix is implemented. There are two types of pre-release versions: Alpha . These have \".alpha\" in the version name and are the most unstable. Expect the most crashes and broken features in these builds. BEWARE! Your data in Key Mapper isn't considered compatible between alpha builds so it is possible that Key Mapper will crash and refuse to fix itself. Beta . These builds have some of the latest features and contain a few bugs. You can safely update between versions. These have \".beta.X\" in the version name. These are pre-release builds for the the open-testing channel on Google Play and F-droid always has beta builds. When all known bugs are fixed a new build is released to the app stores. How can I help? \u00b6 Test and experiment new features. All features and bug-fixes that are being worked on for a release can be found on the Projects page here . If you find any bugs or crashes then report them by following the guide here . Contributing code \u00b6 Introduction to the structure \u00b6 This app follows Clean Architecture and package-by-feature. Architecture \u00b6 All data structures that are persisted are passed around as one of two objects: Non-Entity . This models the data in a way that makes the code more readable and doing the business logic easier. There are no rules for how these need to be named. They should be named what they are. E.g KeyMap, Action, Constraint. Entity . This models how the data should be stored. The class name has an ...Entity suffix. E.g KeyMapEntity. The data is more optimised for storing and the code required to get the data from these models isn't very concise or elegant. The developer took some strange decisions in the first versions of this app. \ud83d\ude06 Every screen in the app has a view model and the view model interacts with one or multiple use cases (more below). The view model converts data that needs to be shown to the user into something that can populate the user interface. For example, the data values in the Action object isn't very useful to the user so this needs to be converted into strings and images that do mean something to the user. All the view models have a ResourceProvider dependency which is how they get strings, Drawables and colours from the resources without having to use a Context. This isn't a problem for configuration changes (e.g locale change) because the activity is recreated, which means all the resources are re-fetched in the view model. The use cases contains all the business logic in the app. A use case interacts with the adapters and repositories mentioned below. A use case is made for everything that can be done in the app. E.g configuring a key map, displaying a mapping, configuring settings, onboarding the user. Most use cases correspond to something that the user can do in the app but some do not because they contain complicated code that is used in multiple use cases. E.g the GetActionErrorUseCase which determines if an action can be performed successfully. Adapters and repositories contain all interactions with the Android framework (except UI stuff). This is so that tests can be more easily written and executed. Android often changes what apps are allowed to do and how so abstracting these interactions away means the code only needs to be changed in a single place. This means that the only place that a Context object is used is in Services, Activities, Fragments and the adapters. Package by feature \u00b6 Every package contains files related to each other. For example, everything (view models, fragments, use cases) to do with constraints is stored in one package. The only package which isn't a feature is the data package because it is useful to have some of the things in there together, e.g the migrations. The system package bundles all the packages which are related to the Android framework because there are so many. Setting up the environment \u00b6 Fork the KeyMapper repository (repo). Clone the repo to your device. It will clone to a folder called KeyMapper by default. Install Android Studio if you don't have it already. It is available for Windows, Linux and macOS. Open the cloned KeyMapper folder in Android Studio. Install anything Android Studio prompts you to install. E.g the gradle wrapper version used by KeyMapper or older Android SDK versions. Create a new branch off develop which begins with \"feature/\" if it is a new feature or \"fix/\" if it is a bug fix. Then put a brief description of the feature/bug fix. Make any changes then commit them to your forked repo then make a pull request! Branches \ud83c\udf34 \u00b6 master: Everything in the latest stable release. develop: The most recent changes. The app is potentially unstable but it can be successfully compiled. Merges into a release branch when enough has been changed for a new release. release/*: Branched off develop. Beta releases for a particular release are compiled from here. Once the code is stable, it will be merged into master. No big changes should be made/merged here as the purpose of this branch is to make a release stable. By separating upcoming releases from develop, new features can be worked on in develop without affecting the upcoming release's code base. feature/*: Any new changes currently being developed. Merges into develop. hotfix/*: Any small, quick (atleast things which SHOULD be quick) changes that need to be made. Merge into develop and release. If there is no release already being worked on, quickly release a new version depending on how critical the issue is and merge the new release branch into master. Committing \u00b6 Format: <issue id> <type>: <subject> Every feature or bug fix commit should have an issue associated with it. This is a cue for the developer to plan what they are doing which improves efficiency. A feature should be split up into multiple tasks and each task should have its own commit. The feature should be developed on a separate branch and then merged into develop. Example \u00b6 #100 feat: This a new feature Types \u00b6 feat: a new feature fix: a bug fix docs: changes to documentation style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change refactor: refactoring production code test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, version name changes, etc; no production code change release: a new release. website: stuff to do with the website. The README, License, Credits, Changelog and Privacy Policy files should just be changed in the master branch. Versioning \u00b6 This project uses semantic versioning. e.g 1.2.3-alpha.01 1st digit: major release. Only incremented when a big enough change happens to the project. 2nd digit: minor releases. Incremented when a new feature or a few are added. 3rd digit: patches. Incrememtend after a hotfix or bug fix. Additional labels can be used as a suffix. e.g \"alpha\". The version code in the develop branch should always be the highest. Therefore, when a new version is released in the release branch, it should be incremented as well. Code Style \u00b6 Follow Google's Kotlin style guide. https://developer.android.com/kotlin/style-guide Translating \ud83c\udf0d \u00b6 You can translate this project on the CrowdIn page . Translations will be merged into production once everything has been translated. If your language isn't available on the CrowdIn page then contact the developer so we can add it. Our contact details are in the footer of every page on this site. We really appreciate translators so thank you! \ud83d\ude42 Consistency Standards \u00b6 Writing \u00b6 It is important to use consistent language within the app's code and documentation. Make sure that your submissions comply with these standards. If you have noticed inconsistencies you can alert the developer with an issue or in the Discord . These standards don't need to be followed in places other than the documentation and source code. Follow this Material Design guide . Case \u00b6 No title case unless it is the title of a webpage, section heading. No title case in the string resources in the source code at all. Here are words and phrases that have been spelt inconsistently by the developer and everyone should follow these guidelines. Terminology Correct \ud83d\ude0d Incorrect \ud83d\udc7f The app's name.

See the Quick Start Guide for more general help with using Key Mapper. \"Can I remap joysticks/dpad/mouse buttons/mouse motion?\" \u00b6 No. Here is why: Joysticks are complicated to remap because they are axes, so their inputs are a range depending on how much you press the stick. It would be a lot of work to integrate them into Key Mapper. The developer currently doesn't have a way to interpret the motion, and if they did, they might not add it into this app anyway because Key Mapper is for mapping keys, not motion. The D-pad is interpreted differently by Android to other keys. That makes it hard to remap. However, the developer has found a way that might be able to remap them. Therefore you can consider this a planned feature. It might take something like 6 months to see this in a build of Key Mapper. Mouse buttons are not possible to remap with an accessibility service. There will never be support for them in this app. If other apps can do it, they do not work the same way Key Mapper does. If you want to remap mouse buttons, do not use Key Mapper. Remapping the movement of the mouse is completely out of scope for this app. This is an app for remapping keys, not motion. If you want that kind of functionality, please don't look for it in Key Mapper or request this as a feature. There may be other apps that can help you (I don't know any of them though). \"Key Mapper keeps randomly stopping/crashing/bugging/freezing\" \u00b6 Please follow the following steps: Turn off battery and memory optimisations in your device settings. This is especially important for Huawei and Xiaomi devices, and devices with 2GB of RAM or less. You can read about how to do this on your particular device at dontkillmyapp.com Reboot your device. This is important for everyone to do if you are experiencing an issue with the app stopping. You must try rebooting your device. It works most of the time. If you have tried BOTH steps and Key Mapper still stops working randomly, consider how you are using the app. If you have low-end hardware, and are playing a game while using repeating key maps, it's probably not a bug. It's probably just too much for your device. If you think you are using Key Mapper in a reasonable way and still experience random crashes, ask about it in the discord server. \"How do I change the keyboard?\" \u00b6 There are multiple ways to do this. Tap the keyboard button at the bottom of your display when you are typing something. Not all devices have this and some devices have this feature hidden behind a setting somewhere. Tap the notification that allows you to change the keyboard when you are typing something. Not all devices have this. Open Key Mapper and tap \"show input method picker\" in the menu . Tip If you want to switch between one of the Key Mapper keyboards and a normal keyboard when a device, such as a keyboard or game controller, connects/disconnects then Key Mapper can do this for you automatically. Set it up here . \"My keyboard doesn't appear when using the app.\" \u00b6 Key Mapper Basic Input Method (the keyboard built-in to the app) has no GUI/buttons. You can install the Key Mapper GUI Keyboard to get a proper keyboard that can also perform Key Mapper actions. \"Why don't my volume buttons work when I press them?\" \u00b6 Give the app Do Not Disturb access in your device settings. At the top of the homescreen in the Key Mapper app there is a \"Fix\" button to do this. \"Why aren't the buttons on my Bluetooth device detected?\" \u00b6 Many Bluetooth devices (like headphones) aren't supported by Key Mapper out of the box. Bluetooth keyboards work most of the time. If you are willing and able to do some simple debugging, perhaps by installing utility apps or using ADB, join the Discord server and we will try our best to get it working for you. \"Why doesn't the app open in Dex mode?\" \u00b6 Samsung Dex doesn't allow apps with a 3rd party keyboard to open while in Dex mode. You can still configure key maps while out of Dex mode and your key maps which don't require a Key Mapper keyboard will still work in Dex mode. \"Why doesn't the app uninstall?\" \u00b6 You have probably enabled the app's device administrator in your device's settings. To uninstall the app, you must turn it off. The location of the device admin settings page varies on devices but on skins close to stock-Android it is under \"Security\" -> \"Device admin apps\". If you need help, ask in the Discord server. \"Why can't I remap some of my Joy Con buttons?\" \u00b6 Not all the Joy Con buttons are visible to accessibility services. There isn't anything the developer can do. I tested the app on SwitchRoot Android and this is what works... Working: ZL (Button L2) L (Button L1) - (Select) + (Start) Left analog stick button (unknown keycode 0) ZR (Button R2) R (Button R1) X (Button X) Y (Button Y) B (Button B) A (Button A) Home (Home) Volume up (Vol up) Volume down (Vol down) Not working: Screenshot button All D-Pad buttons (used by OS) Both analog sticks (used by OS) Right analog stick button SR and SL (left joycon) SR and SL (right joycon) Power button \"Add on-screen buttons to Key Mapper\" \u00b6 On-screen buttons are not a planned feature. In the near future, it will not be possible for apps to do this, even if some apps can right now. There is currently no work being done on adding on-screen buttons. Google is removing the ability for apps to draw overlays over other apps. This is called the \"system alert window\" feature in the developer world. Android Go devices already can't do this. \"A game doesn't detect my key maps\" \u00b6 Unsupported games - Fortnite There is no guarantee that your key maps will work in games. The app isn't designed for it. Follow this guide if you are remapping buttons on a game controller to different buttons on a game controller. Connect your controller to your device. Create a trigger for whatever button you want to remap. Press \"Add Action\" and create a \"Key Event\" action by going to the \"Key Event\" tab. Choose your keycode AND select your controller as the device in the dropdown menu. Save the keymap and hopefully it will work. \"How can I 'jump bridge' with Key Mapper? / How can I use Key Mapper for Minecraft PVP?\" \u00b6 This is not an app designed for gaming. Please look elsewhere for help with this, such as YouTube tutorials or ask in the discord server. Also note that use of 'jump bridging' or very fast attacks on Minecraft servers where it is not allowed has absolutely nothing to do with the developer and it is not endorsed or encouraged. Again, this is not an app optimised for playing mobile games. \"Can I use the app on Chromebook?\" \u00b6 Not all features work on Chromebook. The app is not supported on Chromebook. Key Mapper can't \"tap the screen\" for obvious reasons. If you want to play a game on Chromebook using Key Mapper with keyboard controls (especially Among Us ) then you are unlikely to be able to do so. That being said, many features should work, such as remapping keyboard buttons. \"Can I remap on-screen controls to buttons with Key Mapper?\" \u00b6 Technically yes but it would be a horrendous gaming experience. There is an action in Key Mapper to touch the screen but Key Mapper is only allowed to tap/swipe in one place at a time. Therefore, you wouldn't be able to tap forward on an on-screen joystick and shoot at the same time for example. This is how the Android API works and there is nothing I can do to change it. Ask for help \"Can I remap my Bixby button?\" \u00b6 Key Mapper doesn't yet offer a way to remap the Bixby button but if you are rooted you can remap the Bixby button to something that Key Mapper can remap. Follow this guide on XDA.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#can-i-remap-joysticksdpadmouse-buttonsmouse-motion","text":"No. Here is why: Joysticks are complicated to remap because they are axes, so their inputs are a range depending on how much you press the stick.

Info This guide is updated to match current stable release UI. Report inaccuracies. First time setup \u00b6 When you open Key Mapper, you will be presented with this screen. This screen is referred to as the Key Mapper home screen. Set up the accessibility service \u00b6 Tapping the FIX button next to the accessibility service prompt will allow you to grant Key Mapper permission to run its accessibility service. You must do this for the app to work at all. You can then tap Key Mapper in your list of available services. There may be many others on this screen and your interface may be slightly different. Attention If nothing happens when you tap FIX, or if you can't enable the service, see this page or ask for help in the Discord server. Disable app-killing \u00b6 Important If you are using a Huawei or Xiaomi branded device, a device with 2GB of RAM or less, or intend to use the app while playing a mobile game, it is especially important to follow the next step. Tapping the FIX button next to the battery optimisation prompt will allow you to turn off features of your device that may prevent Key Mapper's essential services from running in the background. This is usually the source of the common 'Key Mapper randomly stops working' issue. Devices older than Android 6.0 do not have this prompt in Key Mapper. However, I was still able to find the setting in my device settings app. Read more below for details. The screen that opens after tapping FIX may vary depending on your device. In my case, to disable optimisation I found the app(s) in the list, tapped them to open their settings, and chose 'Don't optimise' and on the second device, 'Disabled'. Tip There is an excellent guide at dontkillmyapp.com that explains how to disable battery and/or memory optimisation for your specific device. If Key Mapper randomly stops working even after you complete these steps, ask for help in the Discord server. Creating a key map \u00b6 Summary A key map is an association between a user input (such as pushing a key or button) and a response from the device (sending information about what key was pressed and for how long). In Key Mapper, 'user inputs' that are recognised by the app are called 'triggers'. The responses from your device that were due to a trigger being pressed are called 'actions'. Key Mapper lets you assign actions to triggers that may be different from their default use. A 'volume up' trigger normally increases the volume when pressed, but this app can change that to something else. This guide deals with 'Key event' triggers. If you want to remap fingerprint gestures, check out this guide. Setting the trigger(s) \u00b6 To create your first key map, tap the + icon at the bottom of the Key Mapper home screen. You will see the screen below. On larger screens this will look slightly different because multiple tabs will be merged into one tab. In either case, the first step is to record a trigger. Tap the red 'Record trigger' button and then press the physical button that you want to change the function of. In this guide I will demonstrate with 'volume down'. Key Mapper can also create a key map with multiple triggers. If you want to use more than one trigger for one key map, you can press the buttons in the order you will press them to execute the key map. For example, if you wanted to map 'Ctrl' + 'H' to show the device home menu you should press 'Ctrl' and then 'H'. Key Mapper can also remap fingerprint gestures on many devices. You can learn how to do this here. You should see this screen after pressing volume down. Setup the ability to properly remap volume buttons \u00b6 You only need to do this on Android 6.0+. If you want to remap volume buttons and use them when Do Not Disturb is enabled, you should grant Key Mapper permission to do so. Key Mapper will show the error in the picture above if you need to do this. Tapping FIX will allow you to grant the permission. Find Key Mapper in the list and tap it in order to choose 'Allowed'. Setting the action(s) \u00b6 Next, it's time to choose an action. If you have a large screen, you will see the 'Add action' button at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise, tap the 'Actions' tab at the top of the screen and then you will see the 'Add action' button. Tap the 'Add action' button at the bottom of this screen. The action selection screen will open. Here you can choose from a wide variety of actions. Swipe left and right to change category, and scroll up and down the list until you find the action you want to add. Below is a table of the different kinds of actions you can choose from in each tab. Tab Description App Choose an app to open when you press your trigger. App shortcut Choose an app operation (such as sharing location, checking local traffic, sending a text message) Key code Emulate a keyboard key press (such as an alphanumeric character or multimedia key) System Choose a system operation (such as toggling Bluetooth, opening the home menu, toggling flashlight) Key An alternative way to choose a key press action, by pressing the key that you want to map to. Tap screen (2.1.0+) Emulate a screen tap at a specific location on your screen. Key event (2.1.0+) Emulate a key press from a specifc connected device. Text Emulate typing a string. Intent (2.3.0+) See this page. Phone call (2.3.0+) Call a telephone number. Network and carrier rates will apply. Unsupported actions A list of actions that your device won't allow you to use. Android frequently changes what users are allowed to do between versions. For this simple demonstration I will choose KEYCODE_0 from the Keycode tab. This action will emulate pressing the 0 key on a keyboard. Key Mapper will let you know if you need to do any extra steps so that an action can work. In the picture there is an error message in the action telling you to 'enable' a Key Mapper keyboard. Tapping the action will take you to the correct place so that you can fix the error. I will walk through how to set up a key code action since these are the most used. Tip Key Mapper can also create a key map with multiple actions. If you want to add more actions to execute in series you can do so by tapping 'Add action' again and choosing the next action in the chain. You can drag and drop the actions into whatever order you like. In the next section you can specify a delay between those actions if you wish. Fixing the action(s) \u00b6 Tap the action to fix the error. If you are creating a key code, key event or text action then you MUST read this guide In this case tapping the action will take you to the 'Language & Input' settings on your device. On a stock Android 11 Pixel 2 this is what it looks like. You will see a list of all the installed input methods on your device. It is important to have read the guide in step 2 to understand what is happening from now on. On my device I installed the Key Mapper GUI Keyboard so I am going to turn this one on. Press back to go back to Key Mapper. There is now a 2nd thing that needs to be fixed as you can see in the picture. Tap the action again and the input method picker will show up as shown in the picture. On Android 11+ Key Mapper can fix this error for you without showing the input method picker if you have enabled the accessibility service. Since I enabled the Key Mapper GUI Keyboard I will use that input method with Key Mapper. If you followed these steps correctly then Key Mapper will stop showing any error messages underneath the action as shown. This action will now work. Customising a key map \u00b6 You may wish to customise your triggers and actions to have specific behaviours. Most people will want to do at least some customisation. Trigger settings \u00b6 Starting with the triggers, tap the 3 dot menu to the right of the trigger's name to bring up the following menu. You can choose from four different settings. Turning on \"Do not override default action\" will mean that Key Mapper will not replace the normal operation of your trigger, instead it will execute the key map as well as the default operation. One trigger can have three different click types. Choose from short press, long press and double press. Read more. Customising actions \u00b6 Next, tap the 3 stacked dots to the right of the action's name to bring up the following menu. Here you can customise a lot of the operation of your key map, including timing and multipliers. The following details refer to action timing settings. Delay before next action (ms) Key Mapper 2.2.0+ This option takes effect if you have multiple actions in your mapping. The slider sets the amount of time between this action and the next. How many times Key Mapper 2.1.0+ On Key Mapper 2.2.0 and 2.1.0 this is called \"action count\". This option serves as a multiplier. If this is equal to 5 when your mapping is triggered then your action will be performed 5 times. If this is used with the 'repeat' option then this will perform the action this many times every time it repeats. Repeating actions \u00b6 Repeat When this is turned on, Key Mapper will execute your actions repeatedly. This is particularly useful when emulating a keyboard key press, where in most applications holding down the key would result in a repeating output. The default settings in Key Mapper are designed to emulate that behaviour when 'Repeat' is turned on. Repeat every... (ms) This option sets the time period for your repeating action. If this is set to 200, your action will repeat every 200ms, or in terms of frequency, 5 times per second. Some people prefer to think about this setting as a repeat rate, commonly measured in 'clicks' per second or cps. To calculate the appropriate time period for this option from a desired frequency, use this equation: Time period (ms) = 1000 / Frequency ('cps') Delay until repeat... (ms) This option sets the amount of time between the first action and the second action (or the first repeat). This is part of the keyboard key behaviour simulation. If you want your repeating action to begin straight away, you can make this 0. Stop repeating when... Trigger is released Trigger is pressed again Limit reached Trigger is released . You will need to hold down the trigger in order for the keys to repeat. If you let go of the trigger, the repeating will stop. Trigger is pressed again . Pressing your trigger once will be sufficient to start your repeating key map. To stop the key map, you will need to press the trigger a second time. Limit reached . (Key Mapper 2.3.0+). Your key map will stop repeating once the limit has been reached regardless of whether the trigger is being held down. Hold down actions \u00b6 Hold down Key Mapper 2.1.0+ This setting provides the ability to simulate holding down a key or tapping a coordinate (Android 8.0+). With this turned on (and repeat turned off), the default behaviour is that holding down your trigger will translate to holding down the action, for as long as you hold down the trigger. Hold down until trigger is... Released Pressed again Key Mapper 2.2.0+ This setting allows you to choose from two behaviours. If 'Released' is selected, holding down your trigger key(s) will translate to holding down the action, for as long as you hold down the trigger key(s). If you choose 'Pressed again', pressing your trigger key(s) once will be sufficient to start holding down the action. To stop the key map, you will need to press the trigger key(s) a second time. Using 'Hold down' and 'Repeat' together \u00b6 Key Mapper 2.2.0+ You can use turn on both of these settings to unlock an additional setting. A repeating hold down action behaves like a normal 'Repeat' action in that the action repeats itself with a given frequency. It also behaves like a 'Hold down' action in that each individual action will be held for a certain amount of time in each cycle. Hold down duration (ms) This allows you to set how long the action is held down for before repeating. Special options \u00b6 You can see explanations of more options here . Adding constraints \u00b6 Constraints allow you to restrict your mappings to only work in some situations. To add a constraint fron the 'Constraints and more' or 'Options' tab, tap 'Add constraint'. Go here to see how you can configure constraints. Managing key maps \u00b6 To save your key map and return to the home screen, tap the save icon in the bottom right of the screen. Now your key map should already be working. To pause/unpause all of your key maps, pull down the notification tray and tap the Key Mapper notification to toggle between Paused and Running. On the Key Mapper home screen, tap the 3 bar menu to open the Key Mapper general settings. You will see the following options. Here you can pause/unpause/enable/disable all of your key maps at once. You can also back up and restore key maps here. Learn more about back up and restore. Tapping 'Show input method picker' allows for switching between a Key Mapper compatible keyboard and any other.

For specific troubleshooting, consult the FAQ. Warning This feature of Key Mapper does not support all devices. If you are having trouble with remapping fingerprint gestures, make sure you have read and understood the disclaimer below. Info This guide is updated to match current stable release UI. Report inaccuracies. Disclaimer \u00b6 On some devices, the fingerprint sensor can be remapped by Key Mapper. There are generally 3 categories of devices with varying degrees of support for this feature: Some devices have a fingerprint sensor that can detect directional gestures (up, down, left, right swipes) and your device allows third party apps such as Key Mapper to access and remap these. Some devices have a fingerprint sensor that can detect directional gestures (up, down, left, right swipes) but your device does not allow Key Mapper to access them. Some devices have a fingerprint sensor that is not capable of detecting directional gestures. This generally includes in-screen fingerprint sensors. If your device falls into categories 2 or 3, you cannot remap fingerprint gestures, and you shouldn't continue with this guide. Even if your device allows for directional fingerprint gestures for system use, they may not allow third party apps such as Key Mapper to access them and therefore there is nothing the developer of Key Mapper can do to help you. If your device supports remapping directional fingerprint gestures, this guide is for you. Remapping fingerprint gestures \u00b6 From the Key Mapper home screen, tab the 'Fingerprint' tab. Here you can set actions for the 4 directional gestures. Tapping any one of them will bring you to the action assignment screen for that gesture and by tapping 'Add action' at the bottom of the screen you can assign the action. Click here for an explanation of all the actions you can choose from. After choosing an action (or actions) you can press the save icon in the bottom right to save the mapping. Make sure to save your fingerprint gesture map after applying these changes. Customising actions \u00b6 If you would like to customise how the actions are performed you can tap the 3 dot menu to the right of an action. On this screen you can choose from the following options: Hold down until swiped again This option allows for keycode actions to be 'held', much like you could hold down a physical keyboard key. The action will continue until the same gesture is performed a second time. Delay before next action (ms) Key Mapper 2.2.0+ This option takes effect if you have multiple actions in your mapping. The slider sets the amount of time between this action and the next. How many times Key Mapper 2.1.0+ On Key Mapper 2.2.0 and 2.1.0 this is called \"action count\". This option serves as a multiplier. If this is equal to 5 when your mapping is triggered then your action will be performed 5 times. If this is used with the 'repeat' option then this will perform the action this many times every time it repeats. Repeat until swiped again When this is turned on, Key Mapper will execute your actions repeatedly. This is particularly useful when emulating a keyboard key press, where in most applications holding down the key would result in a repeating output. Repeat every... (ms) This option sets the time period for your repeating action. If this is set to 200, your action will repeat every 200ms, or in terms of frequency, 5 times per second. Some people prefer to think about this setting as a repeat rate, commonly measured in 'clicks' per second or cps. To calculate the appropriate time period for this option from a desired frequency, use this equation: Time period (ms) = 1000 / Frequency ('cps') Repeat limit Key Mapper 2.3.0+ Changing this will change how many times the action will repeat. By default this is set to \"no limit\". Tap 'Save' to close the menu, preserving changes. Special options \u00b6 For extra customisation, tap the 'Constraints and more' tab at the top of the screen when editing or creating a gesture map. On this screen you can choose from the following options: Vibrate Vibrate duration (ms) Tapping 'Vibrate' will cause your device to vibrate whenever you trigger your mapping. You can change how long your device vibrates with the slider. Show an on-screen message When this is turned on, the following notice will come up at the bottom of the screen when ever you trigger your mapping. Adding constraints \u00b6 Constraints allow you to restrict your mappings to only work in some situations. To add a constraint fron the 'Constraints and more' or 'Options' tab, tap 'Add constraint'.

Key Mapper uses its own input methods so that it can type stuff or press buttons for you in other apps. You can not use the input method that you are usually using (E.g Gboard or Samsung Keyboard) when you are using some features in Key Mapper (e.g key code actions) since Android only allows one input method to be used at a time. 'A Key Mapper keyboard' through out this documentation and the app refers to any input method that works with Key Mapper. There are only 2 right now. The one built-in to Key Mapper is called the \"Key Mapper Basic Input Method\". This one has NO on-screen keyboard. You won't see a keyboard when you want to type something. This keyboard doesn't support non-English languages! You are not recommended to use this since it is not a proper keyboard. If you want an on-screen keyboard to be available while using Key Mapper or if you need support for non-English languages, you need to install \"Key Mapper GUI Keyboard\". It is available on the Google Play Store , F-Droid and GitHub. This is the recommended input method for Key Mapper. 'Enable a Key Mapper keyboard' means turning on the input method in your device's 'Language & Input' settings. The location of these settings is often called something else. 'Use/choose a Key Mapper keyboard' means making the Key Mapper keyboard that you have installed the one that shows up when you want to type something. Multiple ways of doing this are described here . Android allows multiple input methods to be enabled but only one to be used at a time.","title":"Setup a Key Mapper keyboard"},{"location":"user-guide/keymaps.html","text":"Refer to the Quick Start Guide for help with creating key maps. This page gives more detail about every option. Make sure to save your key map after applying these changes. Trigger \u00b6 A trigger is a combination of keys that must be pressed in a certain way to 'trigger' the key map. A key map can only have one trigger. You can change the order of the keys by holding down on one and then dragging it into a new position. This is the page to create a trigger for a key map. Trigger modes \u00b6 A trigger with one key doesn't have a mode. Triggers with more than one key can be one of two trigger modes: 'parallel' and 'sequence'. The button for a parallel trigger says 'at the same time' because this is more descriptive. The plus symbol between the keys will change to an arrow if the trigger is a sequence trigger. The developer has called them \"parallel\" triggers because you press it is one word and you press the keys in parallel. Parallel \u00b6 You must press the keys down at the same time to trigger the key map and the must be pressed down in the order as displayed from top to bottom. E.g For the trigger screenshot you must press volume up first and then volume down and not the other away around. Sequence \u00b6 You must press the keys down and up one after another to trigger the key map in a specified amount of time. This timeout is 1000ms by default and this default can be changed in the app settings . You can change the timeout for a specific key map by going to the options page for the key map as explained further down this page. Key click type \u00b6 There are 3 click types: short press, long press and double press. Parallel triggers can only be short pressed or long pressed. The click type can be customised for each key in a sequence trigger by pressing on the 3 dot button on each key. Short press \u00b6 This is a simple press of the key and there are no restrictions to how you press it. The key map is triggered when this key is pressed down and doesn't need to be released to activate it. There are no options for this click type. Long press \u00b6 You need to hold down the key for at least some amount of time for it to trigger the key map. This is 500ms by default and this default can be changed in the app settings . You can change the long press delay for all keys in a key map by going to the options page for the key map as explained further down this page. Double press \u00b6 You need to press down and release the key in rapid succession for it to trigger the key map. You must do this within 300ms by default and this default can be changed in the app settings . You can change the double press timeout for all keys in a key map by going to the options page for the key map as explained further down this page. Key device \u00b6 Tap the button on a key so that Key Mapper only detects the key when it comes from a specific device. The default device is 'this device', which means the Android device that you've installed Key Mapper on. External devices are only listed if they are connected to your Android device when you configure the key map. If you have multiple devices with the same name then turn on the setting to show the first 5 characters of the device ID in the app settings . This will help you distinguish between them. Key options \u00b6 This menu pops up if you press the 3 dot button on a key. Do not override default action \u00b6 Do not override default action This is turned off by default. If this is turned on for a key then the key will still do it's normal thing even though it is remapped. E.g a volume down key with this option will still turn the volume down. Click type \u00b6 This will change the click type for a key in a sequence trigger. A parallel trigger key will not have the click type option because all the keys have the same click type. You will find the buttons to change a parallel trigger's click type above the trigger mode buttons as shown in the image at the top of this Trigger section. Customising actions \u00b6 You can tap the 3 stacked dots to the right of the action's name to bring up the following menu. Here you can customise a lot of the operation of your key map, including timing and multipliers. Delay before next action (ms) Key Mapper 2.2.0+ This option takes effect if you have multiple actions in your mapping. The slider sets the amount of time between this action and the next. How many times Key Mapper 2.1.0+ On Key Mapper 2.2.0 and 2.1.0 this is called \"action count\". This option serves as a multiplier. If this is equal to 5 when your mapping is triggered then your action will be performed 5 times. If this is used with the 'repeat' option then this will perform the action this many times every time it repeats. Repeating actions \u00b6 Repeat When this is turned on, Key Mapper will execute your actions repeatedly. This is particularly useful when emulating a keyboard key press, where in most applications holding down the key would result in a repeating output. The default settings in Key Mapper are designed to emulate that behaviour when 'Repeat' is turned on. Repeat every... (ms) This option sets the time period for your repeating action. If this is set to 200, your action will repeat every 200ms, or in terms of frequency, 5 times per second. Some people prefer to think about this setting as a repeat rate, commonly measured in 'clicks' per second or cps. To calculate the appropriate time period for this option from a desired frequency, use this equation: Time period (ms) = 1000 / Frequency ('cps') Delay until repeat... (ms) This option sets the amount of time between the first action and the second action (or the first repeat). This is part of the keyboard key behaviour simulation. If you want your repeating action to begin straight away, you can make this 0. Repeat limit Key Mapper 2.3.0+ Changing this will change how many times the action will repeat. By default this is set to \"no limit\". Stop repeating when... Trigger is released Trigger is pressed again Limit reached Trigger is released . You will need to hold down the trigger in order for the keys to repeat. If you let go of the trigger, the repeating will stop. Trigger is pressed again . Pressing your trigger once will be sufficient to start your repeating key map. To stop the key map, you will need to press the trigger a second time. Limit reached . (Key Mapper 2.3.0+). Your key map will stop repeating once the limit has been reached regardless of whether the trigger is being held down. Hold down actions \u00b6 Hold down Key Mapper 2.1.0+ This setting provides the ability to simulate holding down a key or tapping a coordinate (Android 8.0+). With this turned on (and repeat turned off), the default behaviour is that holding down your trigger will translate to holding down the action, for as long as you hold down the trigger. Hold down until trigger is... Released Pressed again Key Mapper 2.2.0+ This setting allows you to choose from two behaviours. If 'Released' is selected, holding down your trigger key(s) will translate to holding down the action, for as long as you hold down the trigger key(s). If you choose 'Pressed again', pressing your trigger key(s) once will be sufficient to start holding down the action. To stop the key map, you will need to press the trigger key(s) a second time. Using 'Hold down' and 'Repeat' together \u00b6 Key Mapper 2.2.0+ You can use turn on both of these settings to unlock an additional setting. A repeating hold down action behaves like a normal 'Repeat' action in that the action repeats itself with a given frequency. It also behaves like a 'Hold down' action in that each individual action will be held for a certain amount of time in each cycle. Hold down duration (ms) This allows you to set how long the action is held down for before repeating. Special options \u00b6 There are options for a key map under the 'Options' or 'Constraints and more' tab. Here are explanations of each option. Trigger from other apps (2.3.0+) \u00b6 This allows you to trigger the key map by using a shortcut or by sending an Intent to Key Mapper. Turning this off will stop any shortcuts or Intents for this key map from working. Home screen (launcher) shortcut \u00b6 You can create a home screen shortcut by tapping \"create launcher shortcut\" or by adding the shortcut to your home screen in the same way as a widget. You can also use this shortcut from automation apps like Tasker and Automate without having to create a home screen shortcut. Intent \u00b6 There are many apps that can automate broadcasting Intents such as Tasker and Automate. Intent action \u00b6 io.github.sds100.keymapper.TRIGGER_KEYMAP_BY_UID Intent string extra \u00b6 io.github.sds100.keymapper.KEYMAP_UID and the value is the UUID of the key map. You can copy the UUID in Key Mapper by turning on the \"Trigger from other apps\" option. Intent package (optional but recommended) \u00b6 io.github.sds100.keymapper This will only send the Intent to Key Mapper and no other packages. Warning Add .debug or .ci to the end of all io.github.sds100.keymapper instances in the action, extra and package if your Key Mapper build is a debug or ci build respectively. Show an on-screen message When this is turned on, the following notice will come up at the bottom of the screen when ever you trigger your mapping. You can have your device vibrate instead of an on-screen message if you want. This option is below. Vibrate Vibrate duration (ms) Tapping 'Vibrate' will cause your device to vibrate whenever you trigger your mapping. You can change how long your device vibrates with the slider. Vibrate when keys are initially pressed and again when long pressed This is only shown if the 'at the same time' trigger mode is selected and the trigger needs to be long pressed. This behaves similarly to the on-screen message option above. Detect trigger when screen is off. ROOT only. These are the buttons which can be detected when the screen is off. Let the developer know about any buttons you would also like to be supported. Volume Up Volume Down Headset button Long press delay (ms) This is only shown if a trigger has at least one key that needs to long pressed. This option will change for how long these keys need to be held down. Double press timeout (ms) This is only shown if a trigger has at least one key that needs to double pressed. This option will change the maximum amount of time that a button needs to be double pressed so that it is detected as a double press. Sequence trigger timeout (ms) This is only shown if you've chosen the 'in sequence' trigger mode. This option will change the time limit for how fast you need to complete the trigger.

Workaround for Android 11 bug that sets the device id for input events to -1 (2.3.0+, Android 11+) \u00b6 Info See the Android 11 bug on Google's issue tracker here . There is a bug on Android 11 that changes the device id of all input events (e.g pressing buttons, moving joysticks) to -1 when any accessibility services are enabled. This means that apps can't determine which kind of device an input event came from. This breaks keyboards that aren't using an American English keyboard layout because Android uses the device id of a key event to determine what character to type when a key is pressed. If the device id is -1 Android defaults to the American English keyboard layout. Warning This feature will not fix game controllers because joysticks and triggers send motion events and not key events. Steps to work around this bug... Enable the Key Mapper accessibility service. Open the Key Mapper settings by opening the menu at the bottom of the home screen and then tapping Settings. Scroll down to the 'Workaround for Android 11 bug that sets the device id for input events to -1' setting and turn it on. To avoid confusion and headaches read about how input methods work with Key Mapper here . Tap 'Enable the Key Mapper keyboard' and turn on the Key Mapper GUI Keyboard or the Key Mapper Basic Input Method. Tap 'Use the Key Mapper keyboard' and select the keyboard that you just enabled. It is recommended that you setup the setting to automatically change the on-screen keyboard when the device connects and disconnects. You can find this further up this page.
